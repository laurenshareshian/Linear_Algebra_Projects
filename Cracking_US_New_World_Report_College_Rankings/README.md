This program imports the CSV data from the US News World and Report College Rankings
for the top Liberal Arts Colleges from 2013. It then uses least squares projection to solve for the
weightings US News World & Report assigns to each variable in their analysis. I found this project in Tim Chartier's Life is Linear book.
